Welcome to the homepage of **AntiGameReborn**, the most popular addon for the 
browsergame OGame.

AntiGameReborn provides a lot of useful features for every play style:

* View, sort and filter your espionage reports with the handy spy table
in your Messages.
* Have direct links to TrashSim with everything prefilled.
* Create lists and mark players, alliances and single planets, giving them
individual colors and customizing their appearance to keep track of your targets
effectively.
* Create routines for repetitive tasks such as fleetsaving or gathering your 
daily mine production, making these tasks as little time consuming as possible.
* Click on a player's name to show all of his coordinates (updates weekly).
* Add buildings, researches, ships and defense units to a construction plan to
have an overview of the total costs and to transport the needed resources with
just one click.

activated and deactivated individually.
